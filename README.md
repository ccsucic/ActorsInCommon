This project's goal is to allow a user to download a .exe file that will let them select two or more television shows and find the actors in common between the two shows. In this project, I will utilize web scraping using Scrapy, GUI building using tkinter, data wrangling using Pandas, and list comparison using set semantics.

The idea for this project came from my enjoyment of televisions shows, specifically sitcoms. I noticed one day that four very popular sitcoms, The Office, Parks and Recreation, 30 Rock, and Community were all on NBC. Not only were they on the same network, but they were on the air at the same time from 2009-2013.
Given this fact, I thought it would be interesting to see if these four television shows had any actors or actresses that were on all four. I did this quickly using Excel files and Python Pandas, but I thought others might be interested in seeing if their favorite shows had actors in common. So, I am currently building this project for that purpose.
